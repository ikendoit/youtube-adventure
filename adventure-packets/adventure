1: get url_encoded_fmt_stream_map (or adaptive stream for audio/video), split by ','

  1.1: %25 => '%' (url encoded twice)

  1.2: perform url_decode as this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159253/decoding-url-encoding-percent-encoding
    then: urldecode `cat url_encoded_map` > url_encoded_map

  1.3: vim, do: `:%s/&/\&\r/g`

    => every `{ur;: ...}` is a packet

  1.4 curl https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xjv2-F6Quls | grep -o "(yts.*base.js|sts)"
    
    => got the player url of this video

    (each video has a different version of a player, only to misdirect me ?)

  note: get that function from base.js => how can I eval it to decrypt signature ?
